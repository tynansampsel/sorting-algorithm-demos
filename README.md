# Sorting Algorithm Demo

This React app is a sorting algorithm demo that allows users to compare the performance of three sorting algorithms: JavaScript's built-in sort, Bubble Sort, and Merge Sort. Users can click buttons to trigger each sort and observe the time it takes for the sorting operation to complete.

## Usage

1. Click on the buttons to trigger the sorting algorithms:
   - **Built-in Sort**: Uses JavaScript's built-in `Array.prototype.sort` method.
   - **Bubble Sort**: Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm.
   - **Merge Sort**: Implements the Merge Sort algorithm.

2. Wait for each sorting operation to complete.

3. The demo will display the time taken for each sorting algorithm in milliseconds.
